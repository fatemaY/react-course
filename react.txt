Git switch main- to go back to the main branch
Git branch —show-current :to know which branch we’re in.
Git checkout -b “” : create a new branch

Create a react app in a new folder and push it to your repo, 
after this in the terminal use the git branch checkout command to
 create a new branch. After creating it try to go back to your main branch
 to see that everything is working! Tip- 
I use the GitHub desktop to publish and push branches to my remote repo, 
btw I can move and switch between branches using the desktop app, 
but prefer to do it in the terminal just to remember the commands.
