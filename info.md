A module in Node.js is like a separate file that contains its own set of code, including variables, functions, or other pieces of logic. It's like a small compartment where you can organize and store specific tasks or features of your program. Modules help keep code organized, prevent conflicts between different parts of your program, and make it easier to reuse code in different files

## Node Module Scope:

Yes, a Node module is essentially a JavaScript file with its own scope. Variables and functions defined within a module are scoped to that module, which helps in encapsulation and avoiding global namespace pollution.

## Module Variable Conflict:

Correct. If you have two modules, each with its own variable named the same, there won't be a conflict. Each module maintains its own scope, and variables do not clash with variables of the same name in other modules.

## CommonJS for Import/Export:

Yes, Node.js primarily uses CommonJS for importing and exporting modules. module.exports is used to expose variables, functions, or objects from a module, and require is used to import them in another module.

## Creating and Using Modules:

Correct. You can export a function or any value from a module using module.exports and import it into another module using require. The imported value is then accessible in the importing module.

## Built-In Modules:

True. Node.js provides several built-in modules, including the path module, fs module, http module, etc. These modules offer functionalities commonly needed in various types of applications.

## File Extension and ECMAScript Modules:

Correct. You can change the file extension to .mjs to use ECMAScript modules syntax. Alternatively, you can use the type: module in the package.json file to enable ECMAScript modules.

## CommonJS vs ES Import
